# Investigating the Impact of Environmental Factors and Dietary Choices on Autoimmune Flare-ups

## Objective
I have tried to investigate the impact of environmental factors and dietary choices on autoimmune flare-ups using a dataset from the Flare Up app. I have aimed to find answers to questions like:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** How can we gain a comprehensive understanding of patients data, uncovering hidden insights and patterns?
  
- **Medication-Symptom Relationships:** Is there a discernible connection between the medications patients take and the symptoms they report?

- **Food Categorization:** How can we effectively categorize the myriad food items provided by patients, ensuring meaningful groupings through meticulous data cleaning?

- **Correlation with Environmental Factors:** Are there correlations between patients environmental conditions (pressure, temperature, humidity) and their self-reported disease activity?

## Data Extraction and Overview
- Understanding the 8 million-row dataset from the Flare Up app.
- Overview of collected data types: symptoms, medications, weather, and dietary information.

## Data Preprocessing
- Merging and cleaning symptom data into meaningful groups.
- Creating contingency tables to analyze symptom-medication relationships.

## Environmental Factors and Disease Activity
- Investigating correlations between environmental factors (pressure, temperature, humidity) and autoimmune disease activity.

## Dietary Analysis
- Employing semi-supervised machine learning, including BERT, to categorize food data as "junk" or "non-junk."

- Exploring correlations between dietary choices and disease activity.
